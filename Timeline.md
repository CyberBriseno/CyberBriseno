## 05/08/2023 - 07/20/2023: Basic Combat Training (BCT)

### Overview
During this period, I underwent Basic Combat Training (BCT) with the U.S. Military. This rigorous training program served as the foundation of my military career and provided invaluable insights into teamwork, discipline, and the importance of physical and mental resilience.

### Key Takeaways
1. **Self-Reliance**: The training emphasized the importance of being self-reliant, particularly in high-stress environments.
2. **Self-Awareness**: BCT brought a heightened sense of self-awareness, enabling better decision-making under pressure.
3. **Discipline**: The structured routine and rigorous physical activities instilled a strong sense of discipline that is crucial in the cybersecurity field.
4. **Teamwork**: Learning to operate as part of a unit is invaluable not just in military operations but also in tackling complex cybersecurity challenges.
5. **Stress Management**: The high-intensity nature of BCT taught effective stress management techniques, crucial for high-stakes cybersecurity tasks.

### Reflection
The journey through Basic Combat Training was not immediately rewarding; it presented numerous challenges that tested my limits on multiple fronts. However, as I navigated through these trials, the cumulative experience proved to be enriching. The lessons learned, both explicit and implicit, have shaped my perspective and will undoubtedly influence my future endeavors in cybersecurity.

## 07/21/2023 - Current: Advanced Individual Training (AIT)

### Overview
Following Basic Combat Training, I transitioned to Advanced Individual Training (AIT) where the focus has shifted to specialized skills essential for my MOS as a 25B Information Technology Specialist. The training is comprehensive, covering a wide range of IT topics, including computer fundamentals, networking, and communication protocols.

### Key Learnings
1. **Computer Basics**: Gained foundational knowledge in how computers compute, understanding both hardware and software components.
2. **Networking**: Acquired a strong understanding of how networks communicate, including the basics of TCP/IP, subnetting, and routing protocols.
3. **Communication Protocols**: Delved into various communication protocols to understand how different technologies and devices communicate.
4. **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**: Introduced to the basics of cybersecurity, including common vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
5. **Hands-On Experience**: Engaged in practical exercises that simulate real-world IT scenarios, offering a holistic understanding of how theory translates to practice.

### Ongoing Focus
As the training is still in progress, my current focus is on:
- Deepening my understanding of networking concepts
- Gaining practical experience through lab exercises
- Preparing for initial IT certifications to solidify my foundational knowledge

### Reflection
The transition from Basic Combat Training to Advanced Individual Training has been enlightening. While BCT laid the foundation of discipline and resilience, AIT is shaping the technical skills that I will utilize in my military and civilian career in cybersecurity. It's an ongoing journey, and each day brings new challenges and learning opportunities that I am eager to tackle.
